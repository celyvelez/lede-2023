<h2>Project 01 | <a href="https://celyvelez.github.io/lede-2023/project-01/" target="_blank">How social context makes a difference in women in maths</a></h2>
<p>We know women are underrepresented in STEM, but just by how much? Here's a closer look at the gender distribution in the Mathematics Department at the University of the Andes in Bogot√°, Colombia.</p>
<p><b>Data collection:</b> I went through every single syllabus for the maths electives from the first semester of 2017 to the first semester of 2023. From them, I built my own <a href="https://github.com/celyvelez/lede-2023/blob/4d08b3ff6ad1b223a99d483f70b65481c72c4ea5/project-01/dataset" target="_blank">dataset</a> on Google Sheets. I also used data available from my university's <a href="https://planeacion.uniandes.edu.co/images/BoletinEstadistico/Boletn_Estadstico_2022.pdf" target="_blank"> Statistics Bulletin</a>.</p>
<p><b>Data analysis:</b> I used Google Sheets for all the necessary analysis.</p>
